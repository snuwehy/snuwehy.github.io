<!-- this is a comment, wuz good. im tyring to code my website from scratch, 
 learning HTML with the given same time I guess for the game but also  fun of it-->

<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- helps browsers display web pages correctly depending on the page code type-->
<html> <!-- "all HTML documents start and end with this tag", it is the root of an HTML document-->
<head>
<title>i guess a title goes here, but it's not displayed anywhere. strange</title>
<!-- if you pay attention, this is the tab's "title". i see.-->
</head>

<body> <!-- the document's actual body-->

<h1>yo, snuwehy here; my first website, completely from scratch</h1>
<!-- HTML Headings, defined between h1 to h6, heading just vary the size of text?-->

<p>I haven't touched HTML, nontheless even think about building a whole website but this is what
    this page is for.</p>
<!-- p tag defines text as paragraph -->

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com"> This is what I am referencing to build this page</a>
<!-- a tag defines a link, where href is the actual destination of linked attribute-->

<br> <!-- add as part of the HTML Elements page-->

<img src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/054/834/thinking.jpg" alt="monkey thinking image" width="300" height="142">
<!-- displaying images, src is image source file, alt for alternative text, width & height for size-->
<!-- eveything about this point is soley based on the "HTML Basic" page-->

<!-- syntax of a line of HTML, <tagname> element content </tagname> 
        element is everything, the start and end tag, it IS the line of code
    - <h1> My First Heading </h1>, <h1> & </h1> are tags, "My First Heading" is the Element content
        -->

<!-- note, some HTML elements have no content, these elements are called empty elements
 they do not have an end tag, such as <br>-->

<br>
<!-- line break, an empty element so therefore does not hvae a closing tag,
 BUT DO NOT FORGET CLOSING TAG FOR EVERY OTHER ELEMENT-->

<!-- Continuing on with the Elements page, NESTED HTML ELEMENTS-->
<!-- this already exhibits a nested HTML element, look at the body and html tags, they're containing the elements that we are implementing-->
<!-- so, so far <html> and <body> up to this point contain <title>, <h1>, <p>, <a>, <br>, and <img>-->

<!-- HTML is not case sensitive, so <P> and <p> mean the same thing, cool, that being said,
    lowercase is "the norm" and what I will be practicing-->

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp"> practice making a link</a>
<!-- that is it for the HTML Elements Page, push.-->
