<!-- this is a comment, wuz good. im tyring to code my website from scratch, 
 learning HTML with the given same time I guess for the game but also  fun of it-->

<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- helps browsers display web pages correctly depending on the page code type-->
<html> <!-- "all HTML documents start and end with this tag"-->
<head>
<title>i guess a title goes here, but it's not displayed anywhere. strange</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>yo, snuwehy here; my first website, completely from scratch</h1>
<!-- HTML Headings, defined between h1 to h6, heading just vary the size of text?-->

<p>I haven't touched HTML, nontheless even think about building a whole website but this is what
    this page is for.</p>
<!-- p tag defines text as paragraph -->

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com"> This is what I am referencing to build this page</a>
<!-- a tag defines a link, where href is the actual destination of linked attribute-->

<br> <!-- add as part of the HTML Elements page-->

<!-- displaying images, src is image source file, alt for alternative text, width & height for size-->
<!-- eveything about this point is soley based on the "HTML Basic" page-->

<!-- syntax of a line of HTML, <tagname> element content </tagname> 
        element is everything, the start and end tag, it IS the line of code
    - <h1> My First Heading </h1>, <h1> & </h1> are tags, "My First Heading" is the Element content
        -->

<!-- note, some HTML elements have no content, these elements are called empty elements
 they do not have an end tag, such as <br>-->
